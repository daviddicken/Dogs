        The Shar-Pei is a type of dog breed known for its deep wrinkles and blue-black tongue. The breed originates from southern China. The English name "Shar-Pei" derives from the British spelling of the older Cantonese shā pèih (沙皮, Mandarin: shā pí), which translates to "sandy skin" and refers to the texture of the breed's short, rough coat. As puppies, Shar-Pei have numerous wrinkles, but as they mature, these loosen and spread out as they "grow into their skin". The Shar-Pei was named in 1978 as one of the world's rarest dog breeds by TIME magazine and Guinness World Records. Although the Shar-Pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century, the American Kennel Club recognized it as their 134th breed only in 1992.[2][3]

    <h2>Is a Shar-Pei right for you?</h2>
    <p>
        The Shar Pei is great family dog that is devoted to and very protective of its family, but they can be a bit wary of strangers.  The Shar Pei is also a good dog for families where children are just that bit older.  This dog also needs consistent training to ensure that the dog knows its place in the family pecking order.
        The Shar Pei will need to get plenty of exercise and mental stimulation and this means daily walks.  These dogs also appreciate a good run but keep in mind they also suffer from the heat.
        The Shar Pei is relatively straightforward to train, but training must also be consistent.  They can also be territorial and strong willed and because of this fact it has been suggested that they are not the best choice for the first time dog owner.
